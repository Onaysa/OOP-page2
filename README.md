# OOP-page2


## Description
- I created a team page that conists of a manager with his full name , Id, his email to be to get hold of him and an office number.
- Three engineers with their full names,  Ids, their emails to reach out to them and their github info.
- One Intern with his full name , Id, email and the school he attends.
- I have used boostrap for the styling of the page.
- I have also used font Awesom to add the little icons next to the names.
- I have used macbook to redcord the video then I uploaded it to screencastify so anyone can have access to it.
- I have used "npm i" to download package.json.


- Why did you build this project? 
Building this project was highly important because it helped understand OOP a lot more and gave me the opportunity to actually work on it.
